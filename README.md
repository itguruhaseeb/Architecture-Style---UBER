<h1> What is Architecture Style UBER?</h1>

UBER is an architecture style. It applies set of architecture , software design patterns in an efficient way. Which provides structural conformance of the overall architecture in a holistic manner. Rather limited to individual view, model and respective controller. This architecture style begins with focus on layers, concerns defining building blocks, ( User Interface, Business, Entities/Model and Exception, REST) control points, inter module communication which collectively sounds UBER :-).

This sample project illustrates the implementation of this architecture style for iOS + Swift
