#What is Architecture Style UBER?
If you're intrigued by the word UBER and assuming that this article is about either the company UBER or its mobile app. Unfortunately it's not :-). So then what is it all about?
I'd like to introduce you to an architecture style mind you not an architecture pattern neither a software design pattern. Which can be applied for building highly scalable, testable mobile applications. I've coined the term "UBER" for this style not because its fancy. However for what it does, that is...
UBER is an architecture style. It applies set of architecture , software design patterns in an efficient way. Which provides structural conformance of the overall architecture in a holistic manner. Rather limited to individual view, model and respective controller. This architecture style begins with focus on layers, concerns defining building blocks, ( User Interface, Business, Entities/Model and Exception, REST) control points, inter module communication which collectively sounds UBER :-).
